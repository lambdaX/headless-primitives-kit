# **App Name**: Headless UI Playground

## Core Features:

- Toggle Showcase: Displays toggle components with different states, controlled by the headless UI logic.
- Button Showcase: Displays button components with different states, controlled by the headless UI logic.
- Input Showcase: Displays input components with different states, controlled by the headless UI logic.
- Checkbox Showcase: Displays checkbox components with different states, controlled by the headless UI logic.
- Undo/Redo Controls: Allows users to undo and redo state changes on the displayed components, via buttons.
- Component Inspector: Presents component state in JSON format, which updates automatically as the state changes.  Copying this text should be easy.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 65%, 50%) or RGB(33, 150, 243). A classic interface blue, indicating a focused, active digital presence.
- Background color: HSL(210, 20%, 95%) or RGB(242, 247, 252). A light, desaturated blue providing a subtle contrast to the components.
- Accent color: HSL(180, 65%, 50%) or RGB(33, 243, 150).  Provides a crisp highlight to active elements in the UI, particularly buttons and toggles.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, clean, and highly readable interface.
- Simple, line-based icons to represent different component states (e.g., disabled, loading, error).
- A clean, grid-based layout with clear separation between the component display area and the controls (state toggles, undo/redo buttons).
- Subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback on user interactions (e.g., hover effects, state changes).
